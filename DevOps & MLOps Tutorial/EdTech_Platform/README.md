## Centralized EdTech Platform – MLOps & DevOps Tutorials

### Overview
This repository is a centralized EdTech platform designed to provide clear, structured, and practical learning paths for modern MLOps and DevOps tooling. It focuses on step-by-step, hands-on tutorials for popular industry tools used to build, deploy, and operate machine learning systems and cloud-native applications.

Each tool has its own folder with guided README files that follow a consistent format:
- README_Overview.md
- README_Installation.md
- README_Configuration.md
- README_Usage.md
- README_BestPractices.md

### 🎯 Goals
- Build a unified learning platform for cloud-native DevOps and MLOps tools.
- Provide hands-on tutorials for beginners and intermediate learners.
- Bridge academic learning and real-world cloud operations with practical workflows.

### 🧩 Repository Structure
- **/MLOps_Tools/**: Tutorials for end-to-end machine learning operations.
  - Each tool (e.g., `DVC`, `Kubeflow`, `MLflow`, `CometML`, `WandB`, `Airflow`, `Feast`, `Hopsworks`, `Metaflow`, `DataRobot`, etc.) has its own folder containing the five guided READMEs listed above.
- **/DevOps_Tools/**: Tutorials for cloud-native development, CI/CD, infrastructure, and observability.
  - Includes folders for `Git`, `Jenkins`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Terraform`, `Ansible`, `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `ArgoCD`, `Istio`, and more—each structured with the same five guided READMEs.
- **/Shared_Resources/**: Cross-cutting resources for quick reference and comparison.
  - `References.md`: Curated references and reading material.
  - `Tool_Comparison_Table.md`: Side-by-side comparisons of capabilities and use cases.
  - `Useful_Links.md`: Handy links to docs, blogs, talks, and community resources.

Naming conventions for tutorial files are standardized for consistency across the platform:
- `README_Overview.md`, `README_Installation.md`, `README_Configuration.md`, `README_Usage.md`, `README_BestPractices.md`.

### ⚙️ Technologies & Topics Covered
- **MLOps tools**: DVC, Kubeflow, MLflow, CometML, Weights & Biases (W&B), Apache Airflow, Feast, Hopsworks, Metaflow, DataRobot, and more.
- **DevOps tools**: Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana, ArgoCD, Istio, and related cloud-native tooling.

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Expansion into adjacent domains: Cloud Security, FinOps, and AIOps.
- Integration of AI-based lab exercises and graded practice modules.
- Addition of automation scripts, sample projects, and live demonstration blueprints.

### 👩‍💻 Author & Academic Info
This project is developed by a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Cloud Computing and Virtualization Technologies. It is designed to bridge classroom theory with industry-grade DevOps/MLOps practices.

Mentor/Supervisor: To be updated as applicable.
